## My process

### What I learned

- how to structure the HTML - what is the header? footer? sections?

### Continued development

- Utilize `clamp` to implement fluid typography wherever there is a font size change across viewport sizes.
  - [https://css-tricks.com/a-complete-guide-to-calc-in-css/](https://css-tricks.com/a-complete-guide-to-calc-in-css/)
  - [min(), max(), and clamp() are CSS magic!](https://css-tricks.com/min-max-and-clamp-are-css-magic/)
- In my current implementation, the hero image is absolutely positioned, and to make that work requires knowing (or setting) the height of the container. That leads to an abrupt change from one image to the next when moving from the mobile view to the table view with the media query. But could there be a better way? I'm not sure at the moment, but want to look more into different techniques for absolute centering, and possibly combining with what I'm learning about using the `clamp` function for fluid typography, maybe. Here are some resources on absolute centering that I'd like to consider:
  - [Absolute Horizontal And Vertical Centering In CSS](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2013/08/absolute-horizontal-vertical-centering-css/)
  - [Absolute Centering CodePen](https://codepen.io/shshaw/details/kOxGQa)
  - [Flexbox Is As Easy As Pie: Designing CSS Layouts](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2013/05/centering-elements-with-flexbox/)

A possible better solution for dynamically sizing the hero image based on the width of the container while still allowing it to overflow the container to some extent. I recommended this kind of approach in [my comment an another person's solution](https://www.frontendmentor.io/solutions/meet-landing-page-scss-bem-grid-flexbox-zztleF0Y-Q):

```css
margin-inline-start: clamp(-2rem, calc((820px - 100vw) / -2), 0px);
```

### Useful resources

- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - Amazing, as always.
